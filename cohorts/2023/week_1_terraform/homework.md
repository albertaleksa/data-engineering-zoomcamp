## Week 1 Homework (Terraform)

In this homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 1. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.
